As the late David Packard of Hewlett-Packard observed, “Marketing is far too important to leave to the marketing
­department.” Increasingly, marketing is not done only by the marketing department; every employee has an impact
on the customer. Marketers now must properly manage all possible touch points: store layouts, package designs,
product functions, employee training, and shipping and logistics.

Relationship Marketing Increasingly, a key goal of marketing is to develop deep, enduring relationships
with people and organizations that directly or indirectly affect the success of the firm’s marketing activities.
Relationship marketing aims to build mutually satisfying long-term relationships with key constituents in order to
earn and retain their business.
Four key constituents for relationship marketing are customers, employees, marketing partners (channels, sup-
pliers, distributors, dealers, agencies), and members of the financial community (shareholders, investors, analysts).
Marketers must create prosperity among all these constituents and balance the returns to all key stakeholders. To
develop strong relationships with them requires understanding their capabilities and resources, needs, goals, and
desires.
